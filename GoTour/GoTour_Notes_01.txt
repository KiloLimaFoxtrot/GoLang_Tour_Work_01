-Receivers and Pointer Receivers
    - methods01.go
    1. GoLang Methods (with Pointer Receivers) are sort of like the
    GoLang version of Objects, which in Java terms have both state and
    behavior, ie states / field values that can be both get and set, and
    behavior / methods that can be called on the object
        - In GoLang, you can declare methods with pointer receivers
        - This means the method receiver type will have the literal
        syntax *T for some type T. (Also, T cannot itself be a pointer
        such as *int.)

          For example, the Scale method in methods01.go is defined on
          *Vertex.

          Methods with pointer receivers can modify the value to which
          the receiver points (as Scale does in methods01.go). Since
          methods often need to modify their receiver, pointer receivers
          are more common than value receivers.
    2. functions with a pointer argument must take a pointer:

       var v Vertex
       ScaleFunc(v, 5)  // Compile error!
       ScaleFunc(&v, 5) // OK

       while methods with pointer receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

       var v Vertex
       v.Scale(5)  // OK
       p := &v
       p.Scale(10) // OK

       -For the statement v.Scale(5), even though v is a value and not a
        pointer, the method with the pointer receiver is called
        automatically.
       -That is, as a convenience, Go interprets the statement v.Scale
       (5) as (&v).Scale(5) since the Scale method has a pointer
       receiver.

    3.  The equivalent thing happens in the reverse direction.

       Functions that take a value argument must take a value of that
       specific type:

       var v Vertex
       fmt.Println(AbsFunc(v))  // OK
       fmt.Println(AbsFunc(&v)) // Compile error!

       while methods with value receivers take either a value or a
       pointer as the receiver when they are called:

       var v Vertex
       fmt.Println(v.Abs()) // OK
       p := &v
       fmt.Println(p.Abs()) // OK

       In this case, the method call p.Abs() is interpreted as (*p).Abs
       ().

   * Hence, for efficiency, if you want to change the original value of
   a variable passed to a function/method, ie modify the value to which
   a receiver points, which will avoid copying the value on each method
   call..
    MAKE ALL FUNCTIONS INTO METHODS WITH RECEIVER ARGUMENTS THAT TAKE
    POINTER RECEIVERS
        - That way, you can pass either values or pointers to the method

2. values to plug into the arguments
"x float64, y float64"
